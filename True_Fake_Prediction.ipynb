[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \\u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \\u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \\u2014  the 400 of us,\\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \\u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \\u201cempathy\\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \\u201cBlack Power demagogues\\u201d and \\u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \\u201cTrust,\\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \\u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \\u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\\u201d The \\u201ctrust bust\\u201d certainly busted Clinton\\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \\u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\\u2019s election \\u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \\u201clie,\\u201d a \\u201ccon,\\u201d \\u201calternative facts,\\u201d and \\u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \\u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \\u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\\u201d she offered. \\u201cThat is not hyperbole. \\u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \\u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \\u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \\u201ccongenital liar\\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \\u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.\",\n          \"Print \\nAn Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she\\u2019d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . \\nGolrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. \\n\\u201cWhen the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment \\u2013 without a warrant \\u2013 and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,\\u201d the article stated. \\n\\u201cOne of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery \\u2013 never published, never presented to anyone,\\u201d the article stated. \\u201cThe narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.\",\n          \"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \\nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \\nBy Lawrence Davidson \\nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country\\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for \\u201cregime change\\u201d in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \\u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \\u201ctrue\\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \\u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \\u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA \\u201cpartnership\\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \\u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\\u201d to coordinate programs in \\u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\\u201d \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \\u201csocial and behavioral sciences\\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \\u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \\u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \\nTherefore, if someone feeds them \\u201csnake oil,\\u201d they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \\u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \\u2013 have different criterion for what is \\u201ctrue\\u201d than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \\u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \\u201c We\\u2019re looking for truth. But we\\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \\u201d Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \\u201ctruth\\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \\u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \\u201cwork.\\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \\u201cgroup think,\\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \\u201cwe know better\\u201d attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you\\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \\u2013 the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers \\u2013 the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class \\u2013 presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare\\u2019s determination that \\u201cwhat is past, is prelude.\\u201d Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will \\u2013 no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.

The main task of the aircraft carrier aviation group is to strike missile and air blows on the terrorists , whose goal is to enter Aleppo. \\\"After the attacks on terrorists' positions, one will have to forget about the support for insurgents from the outside,\\\" the source said. The Russian group in the Mediterranean Sea consists of the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier , the heavy nuclear missile cruiser Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) and large anti-submarine ships Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov. Russia has increased intelligence activities in Syria to establish the areas, where terrorists are concentrated, as well as the routes that they use to move from one area to another. \\\"The militants took advantage of the humanitarian pause and regrouped their forces to prepare for a new breakthrough into the eastern part of Aleppo,\\\" the source added. According to the source, Russia will use new weapons during the upcoming attacks on terrorists . It was said that the Russian warships in the Mediterranean Sea will launch \\\"Caliber\\\" cruise missiles, although it was not specified which ships would be responsible for the launches.

Be Sociable, Share! (Rob Wilson photo) \\nNative American leaders vowed on Saturday to protest through the winter against a North Dakota oil pipeline they say threatens water resources and sacred lands and are planning lawsuits over police treatment of arrested protesters. \\nStanding Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and other tribal leaders were working on providing food, heat and shelter for protesters opposed to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. \\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re just working through some technical details as far as where the land is, and the type of land that can be used for some permanent structures,\\u201d Archambault told reporters in Mandan, North Dakota on Saturday morning. \\nAt least 10 shelters were being readied on tribal land against temperatures that can fall below -35 Fahrenheit (-37 Celsius) for days at time, he said. \\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to put our water at risk,\\u201d said Archambault, who was joined by Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier. \\nThe two leaders said they\\u2019re considering taking legal action against law enforcement. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II said more than 40 people were injured, including broken bones and welts from rubber bullets and bean bag rounds fired by law enforcement on Thursday, Oct. 27th. \\nArchambault said his tribe may pursue a class action over police tactics. Officers in riot gear swept through a protester camp on private land using pepper spray, bean bag rounds and an audio cannon aiming high-pitched \\u201csound cannon\\u201d blasts against demonstrators. At least 142 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday. \\nProtesters had numbers written on their arms and were housed in what appeared to be dog kennels, without bedding or furniture. \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s just wrong to use that type of force on innocent people,\\u201d Archambault said Saturday, Oct. 29, during a press conference in front of the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department. \\nCheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier said he has heard reports of inhumane treatment while people were incarcerated. \\n\\u201cAll they\\u2019re doing is standing up to protect that water,\\u201d Frazier said.

The organization will also call on the Department of Justice to investigate police practices. \\nAIUSA sent a delegation of observers to the area in August and has stayed in contact both with the Indigenous community and those policing the protests since then. Letters had previously been sent to the North Dakota Highway Patrol and the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s office calling for law enforcement officers to respect international human rights standards on the policing of protests. \\n\\u201cOur observers are here to ensure that everyone\\u2019s human rights are protected,\\u201d said Eric Ferrero, director of communications for AIUSA. \\u201cWe\\u2019re deeply concerned about what we heard during our previous visit to Standing Rock and what has been reported to us since.\\u201d \\nIn some instances, police have responded to protesters with pepper spray and bean bags, and in one instance, private security staff used guard dogs. Those recently arrested have reported being strip searched and forced to pay bail for minor offenses. Members of the media and legal observers have also been arrested or charged with minor offenses. \\n\\u201cPeople here just want to stand up for the rights of Indigenous people and protect their natural resources. These people should not be treated like the enemy,\\u201d said Ferrero \\u201cPolice must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response.\\u201d \\nThis picture should be shared far & wide.

[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \\u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \\u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \\u2014  the 400 of us,\\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \\u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \\u201cempathy\\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \\u201cBlack Power demagogues\\u201d and \\u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \\u201cTrust,\\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \\u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \\u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\\u201d The \\u201ctrust bust\\u201d certainly busted Clinton\\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \\u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\\u2019s election \\u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \\u201clie,\\u201d a \\u201ccon,\\u201d \\u201calternative facts,\\u201d and \\u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \\u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \\u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\\u201d she offered. \\u201cThat is not hyperbole. \\u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \\u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \\u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \\u201ccongenital liar\\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \\u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers.

The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country\\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for \\u201cregime change\\u201d in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \\u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \\u201ctrue\\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \\u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \\u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA \\u201cpartnership\\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \\u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\\u201d to coordinate programs in \\u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\\u201d \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \\u201csocial and behavioral sciences\\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \\u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \\u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \\nTherefore, if someone feeds them \\u201csnake oil,\\u201d they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \\u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \\u2013 have different criterion for what is \\u201ctrue\\u201d than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \\u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \\u201c We\\u2019re looking for truth. But we\\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \\u201d Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \\u201ctruth\\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \\u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \\u201cwork.\\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \\u201cgroup think,\\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \\u201cwe know better\\u201d attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you\\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \\u2013 the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers \\u2013 the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class \\u2013 presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare\\u2019s determination that \\u201cwhat is past, is prelude.\\u201d Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will \\u2013 no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.

The main task of the aircraft carrier aviation group is to strike missile and air blows on the terrorists , whose goal is to enter Aleppo. \\\"After the attacks on terrorists' positions, one will have to forget about the support for insurgents from the outside,\\\" the source said. The Russian group in the Mediterranean Sea consists of the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier , the heavy nuclear missile cruiser Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) and large anti-submarine ships Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov. Russia has increased intelligence activities in Syria to establish the areas, where terrorists are concentrated, as well as the routes that they use to move from one area to another. \\\"The militants took advantage of the humanitarian pause and regrouped their forces to prepare for a new breakthrough into the eastern part of Aleppo,\\\" the source added. According to the source, Russia will use new weapons during the upcoming attacks on terrorists . It was said that the Russian warships in the Mediterranean Sea will launch \\\"Caliber\\\" cruise missiles, although it was not specified which ships would be responsible for the launches.

Be Sociable, Share! (Rob Wilson photo) \\nNative American leaders vowed on Saturday to protest through the winter against a North Dakota oil pipeline they say threatens water resources and sacred lands and are planning lawsuits over police treatment of arrested protesters. \\nStanding Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and other tribal leaders were working on providing food, heat and shelter for protesters opposed to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. \\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re just working through some technical details as far as where the land is, and the type of land that can be used for some permanent structures,\\u201d Archambault told reporters in Mandan, North Dakota on Saturday morning. \\nAt least 10 shelters were being readied on tribal land against temperatures that can fall below -35 Fahrenheit (-37 Celsius) for days at time, he said. \\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to put our water at risk,\\u201d said Archambault, who was joined by Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier. \\nThe two leaders said they\\u2019re considering taking legal action against law enforcement. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II said more than 40 people were injured, including broken bones and welts from rubber bullets and bean bag rounds fired by law enforcement on Thursday, Oct. 27th. \\nArchambault said his tribe may pursue a class action over police tactics. Officers in riot gear swept through a protester camp on private land using pepper spray, bean bag rounds and an audio cannon aiming high-pitched \\u201csound cannon\\u201d blasts against demonstrators. At least 142 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday. \\nProtesters had numbers written on their arms and were housed in what appeared to be dog kennels, without bedding or furniture. \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s just wrong to use that type of force on innocent people,\\u201d Archambault said Saturday, Oct. 29, during a press conference in front of the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department. \\nCheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier said he has heard reports of inhumane treatment while people were incarcerated. \\n\\u201cAll they\\u2019re doing is standing up to protect that water,\\u201d Frazier said.

The organization will also call on the Department of Justice to investigate police practices. \\nAIUSA sent a delegation of observers to the area in August and has stayed in contact both with the Indigenous community and those policing the protests since then. Letters had previously been sent to the North Dakota Highway Patrol and the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s office calling for law enforcement officers to respect international human rights standards on the policing of protests. \\n\\u201cOur observers are here to ensure that everyone\\u2019s human rights are protected,\\u201d said Eric Ferrero, director of communications for AIUSA. \\u201cWe\\u2019re deeply concerned about what we heard during our previous visit to Standing Rock and what has been reported to us since.\\u201d \\nIn some instances, police have responded to protesters with pepper spray and bean bags, and in one instance, private security staff used guard dogs. Those recently arrested have reported being strip searched and forced to pay bail for minor offenses. Members of the media and legal observers have also been arrested or charged with minor offenses. \\n\\u201cPeople here just want to stand up for the rights of Indigenous people and protect their natural resources. These people should not be treated like the enemy,\\u201d said Ferrero \\u201cPolice must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response.\\u201d \\nThis picture should be shared far & wide.

[Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed \\u201cno debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be\\u201d (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). \\u201cI am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us \\u2014  the 400 of us,\\u201d Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom \\u2014  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for \\u201cempathy\\u201d for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented \\u201cBlack Power demagogues\\u201d and \\u201celitist arrogance and repressive intolerance\\u201d within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. \\u201cTrust,\\u201d Rodham ironically observed in 1969, \\u201cthis is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said \\u2018Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.\\u2019 What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?\\u201d The \\u201ctrust bust\\u201d certainly busted Clinton\\u2019s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people \\u2014  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to November\\u2019s election \\u2014  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a \\u201clie,\\u201d a \\u201ccon,\\u201d \\u201calternative facts,\\u201d and \\u201ca   assault on truth and reason. \\u201d She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. \\u201cAs the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,\\u201d she offered. \\u201cThat is not hyperbole. \\u201d Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that \\u201cfor too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. \\u201d Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. \\u201cWhy aren\\u2019t I 50 points ahead?\\u201d she asked in September. In May she asks why she isn\\u2019t president. The woman famously dubbed a \\u201ccongenital liar\\u201d by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in \\u2014  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.\",\n          \"Print \\nAn Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story she\\u2019d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . \\nGolrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported. \\n\\u201cWhen the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards came to arrest her husband, they raided their apartment \\u2013 without a warrant \\u2013 and found drafts of stories that Ebrahimi Iraee had written,\\u201d the article stated. \\n\\u201cOne of the confiscated drafts was a story about stoning women to death for adultery \\u2013 never published, never presented to anyone,\\u201d the article stated. \\u201cThe narrative followed the story of a protagonist that watched a movie about stoning of women under Islamic law for adultery.\",\n          \"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 \\nThe tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. \\nBy Lawrence Davidson \\nFor those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. \\nBack in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the country\\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for \\u201cregime change\\u201d in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) \\nFor our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? \\nThe short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. \\nBut the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. government\\u2019s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. \\nWhat we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. \\nSo the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. \\nOn March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. \\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? \\nThe various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out \\u2013 specifically, how to tell when they are getting \\u201ctrue\\u201d intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need \\u201c help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. \\u201d To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. \\nA \\u201cpartnership\\u201d is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a \\u201c permanent Intelligence Community Studies Board\\u201d to coordinate programs in \\u201csocial and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .\\u201d \\nDespite this effort, it is almost certain that the \\u201csocial and behavioral sciences\\u201d cannot give the spy agencies what they want \\u2013 a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. \\nThe Believers \\nIt is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth \\u2013 that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) \\nTherefore, if someone feeds them \\u201csnake oil,\\u201d they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors \\u2013 those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview \\u2013 have different criterion for what is \\u201ctrue\\u201d than do the analysts. \\nListen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council \\u2013 yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, \\u201c We\\u2019re looking for truth. But we\\u2019re particularly looking for truth that works. \\u201d Now what might that mean? \\nI can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, \\u201ctruth\\u201d must match up, fit with, their worldview \\u2013 their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not \\u201cwork.\\u201d So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by \\u201cgroup think,\\u201d ideological blinkers, and a \\u201cwe know better\\u201d attitude. \\nOn the other hand, as long as what you\\u2019re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory \\u2013 the list is almost endless. \\nWhat does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers \\u2013 the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class \\u2013 presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. \\nIt has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeare\\u2019s determination that \\u201cwhat is past, is prelude.\\u201d Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will \\u2013 no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power.

The main task of the aircraft carrier aviation group is to strike missile and air blows on the terrorists , whose goal is to enter Aleppo. \\\"After the attacks on terrorists' positions, one will have to forget about the support for insurgents from the outside,\\\" the source said. The Russian group in the Mediterranean Sea consists of the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier , the heavy nuclear missile cruiser Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) and large anti-submarine ships Severomorsk and Vice-Admiral Kulakov. Russia has increased intelligence activities in Syria to establish the areas, where terrorists are concentrated, as well as the routes that they use to move from one area to another. \\\"The militants took advantage of the humanitarian pause and regrouped their forces to prepare for a new breakthrough into the eastern part of Aleppo,\\\" the source added. According to the source, Russia will use new weapons during the upcoming attacks on terrorists . It was said that the Russian warships in the Mediterranean Sea will launch \\\"Caliber\\\" cruise missiles, although it was not specified which ships would be responsible for the launches.

Be Sociable, Share! (Rob Wilson photo) \\nNative American leaders vowed on Saturday to protest through the winter against a North Dakota oil pipeline they say threatens water resources and sacred lands and are planning lawsuits over police treatment of arrested protesters. \\nStanding Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said he and other tribal leaders were working on providing food, heat and shelter for protesters opposed to the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. \\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re just working through some technical details as far as where the land is, and the type of land that can be used for some permanent structures,\\u201d Archambault told reporters in Mandan, North Dakota on Saturday morning. \\nAt least 10 shelters were being readied on tribal land against temperatures that can fall below -35 Fahrenheit (-37 Celsius) for days at time, he said. \\n\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to put our water at risk,\\u201d said Archambault, who was joined by Cheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier. \\nThe two leaders said they\\u2019re considering taking legal action against law enforcement. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II said more than 40 people were injured, including broken bones and welts from rubber bullets and bean bag rounds fired by law enforcement on Thursday, Oct. 27th. \\nArchambault said his tribe may pursue a class action over police tactics. Officers in riot gear swept through a protester camp on private land using pepper spray, bean bag rounds and an audio cannon aiming high-pitched \\u201csound cannon\\u201d blasts against demonstrators. At least 142 people were arrested on Thursday and Friday. \\nProtesters had numbers written on their arms and were housed in what appeared to be dog kennels, without bedding or furniture. \\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s just wrong to use that type of force on innocent people,\\u201d Archambault said Saturday, Oct. 29, during a press conference in front of the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department. \\nCheyenne River Sioux Chairman Harold Frazier said he has heard reports of inhumane treatment while people were incarcerated. \\n\\u201cAll they\\u2019re doing is standing up to protect that water,\\u201d Frazier said. Here come reinforcements!

The organization will also call on the Department of Justice to investigate police practices. \\nAIUSA sent a delegation of observers to the area in August and has stayed in contact both with the Indigenous community and those policing the protests since then. Letters had previously been sent to the North Dakota Highway Patrol and the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s office calling for law enforcement officers to respect international human rights standards on the policing of protests. \\n\\u201cOur observers are here to ensure that everyone\\u2019s human rights are protected,\\u201d said Eric Ferrero, director of communications for AIUSA. \\u201cWe\\u2019re deeply concerned about what we heard during our previous visit to Standing Rock and what has been reported to us since.\\u201d \\nIn some instances, police have responded to protesters with pepper spray and bean bags, and in one instance, private security staff used guard dogs. Those recently arrested have reported being strip searched and forced to pay bail for minor offenses. Members of the media and legal observers have also been arrested or charged with minor offenses. \\n\\u201cPeople here just want to stand up for the rights of Indigenous people and protect their natural resources. These people should not be treated like the enemy,\\u201d said Ferrero \\u201cPolice must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation. Confronting men, women, and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response.\\u201d \\nThis picture should be shared far & wide.

Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.

He was caught using private email for work purposes while he was trying to take down Hillary Clinton for doing the same. And last week he flat out lied about an FBI letter in clear violation of federal law under the Hatch Act. But just when you think Chaffetz can\\u2019t be dirtier, it turns out his campaign is literally being funded by a criminal enterprise controlled by overseas investors. \\nThe single biggest campaign donor Jason Chaffetz is a company called Nu Skin Enterprises. Research done by Reverb Press has revealed that it adds up to nearly six figures in total, a surreal dollar amount for a fairly obscure company to give to a single Congressmen. But despite the lack of name recognition, Nu Skin is a billion dollar pyramid scheme which pushes questionable anti-aging miracle cures. And it\\u2019s been busted by the Feds for criminal behavior resulting in tens of millions of dollars in penalties. \\nBizarrely, Nu Skin Enterprises is now being bought up by overseas Chinese investors to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, placing the company largely under overseas control even as it\\u2019s begun its illegal business practices into China. Included in the investors list: family members of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. So what does this all have to do with Congressman Jason Chaffetz? In short, a busted criminal pyramid scheme now controlled by Chinese political figures has been funding its very own member of Congress from the very start of his political career. In fact, before entering politics, Chaffetz used to be an employee of the company. With each new turn, the story grows stranger.

[The Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader levelled the accusation at Chancellor Angela Merkel personally, according to EU Observer, while addressing a rally in Istanbul.  \\u201cYou are right now employing Nazi measures,\\u201d he declared. \\u201cAgainst who? My Turkish brother citizens in Germany and brother ministers. \\u201d The   \\u201cModerate Islamist\\u201d was referring to the Merkel administration refusing to allow the AKP to organise political rallies in Germany ahead of a Turkish referendum on 16 April. Germany is home to around three million Turks, and Erdo\\u011fan has been keen to court them, as well as other European diaspora communities, in support of his bid to increase executive powers. Chancellor Merkel said the slurs broke \\u201cevery taboo\\u201d and disrespected genuine victims of the Nazis. She said she would consider revoking permissions for AKP campaign events which have already been granted if the insults continued. Erdo\\u011fan has shown no signs of deescalating his rhetoric, accusing the Germans of \\u201charbouring terrorists\\u201d from Turkey\\u2019s embattled Kurdish minority.

Because they will go there to conquer it. And they will conquer it with their sons.

The President of the European Commission,   Juncker, attempted to downplay the threat, saying \\u201cit is not in Turkey\\u2019s interests to have smuggling rings and bandits in charge along its coast\\u201d.

Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.

He was caught using private email for work purposes while he was trying to take down Hillary Clinton for doing the same. And last week he flat out lied about an FBI letter in clear violation of federal law under the Hatch Act. But just when you think Chaffetz can\\u2019t be dirtier, it turns out his campaign is literally being funded by a criminal enterprise controlled by overseas investors. \\nThe single biggest campaign donor Jason Chaffetz is a company called Nu Skin Enterprises. Research done by Reverb Press has revealed that it adds up to nearly six figures in total, a surreal dollar amount for a fairly obscure company to give to a single Congressmen. But despite the lack of name recognition, Nu Skin is a billion dollar pyramid scheme which pushes questionable anti-aging miracle cures. And it\\u2019s been busted by the Feds for criminal behavior resulting in tens of millions of dollars in penalties. \\nBizarrely, Nu Skin Enterprises is now being bought up by overseas Chinese investors to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, placing the company largely under overseas control even as it\\u2019s begun its illegal business practices into China. Included in the investors list: family members of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. So what does this all have to do with Congressman Jason Chaffetz? In short, a busted criminal pyramid scheme now controlled by Chinese political figures has been funding its very own member of Congress from the very start of his political career. In fact, before entering politics, Chaffetz used to be an employee of the company. With each new turn, the story grows stranger.

[The Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader levelled the accusation at Chancellor Angela Merkel personally, according to EU Observer, while addressing a rally in Istanbul.  \\u201cYou are right now employing Nazi measures,\\u201d he declared. \\u201cAgainst who? My Turkish brother citizens in Germany and brother ministers. \\u201d The   \\u201cModerate Islamist\\u201d was referring to the Merkel administration refusing to allow the AKP to organise political rallies in Germany ahead of a Turkish referendum on 16 April. Germany is home to around three million Turks, and Erdo\\u011fan has been keen to court them, as well as other European diaspora communities, in support of his bid to increase executive powers. Chancellor Merkel said the slurs broke \\u201cevery taboo\\u201d and disrespected genuine victims of the Nazis. She said she would consider revoking permissions for AKP campaign events which have already been granted if the insults continued. Erdo\\u011fan has shown no signs of deescalating his rhetoric, accusing the Germans of \\u201charbouring terrorists\\u201d from Turkey\\u2019s embattled Kurdish minority.

Because they will go there to conquer it. And they will conquer it with their sons.

The President of the European Commission,   Juncker, attempted to downplay the threat, saying \\u201cit is not in Turkey\\u2019s interests to have smuggling rings and bandits in charge along its coast\\u201d. He added that many Turks in Europe are not interested in undermining their host nations, asserting: \\u201cNot all Turks are little Erdo\\u011fans. \\u201d Germany\\u2019s   population, infuriated by the Islamist president, organised a   rally opposing any increase in his powers on 18 March. #Turkey furious as 30, 000 Kurds rally in Frankfurt with PKK insignia, urging \\u201dno\\u201d to referendum on Erdogan\\u2019s powers https:  .   \\u2014   AFP news agency (@AFP) March 18, 2017, \",\n          \"\\nWikiLeaks has released the 34th batch of emails from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton\\u2019s campaign chair, John Podesta, on the eve of the election.

Hornberger   As US officials continue to accuse Russia of meddling with the US presidential election, an accusation that they have provided no evidence whatsoever to support, let\\u2019s review some of the US government\\u2019s history of meddling with elections in others countries.1. In 1951, the democratically elected parliament of Iran elected a man named Mohammad Mossadegh to be Iran\\u2019s prime minister. Mossadegh angered British Empire officials by nationalizing British oil interests in the country.British officials then turned to the CIA for assistance. In 1953, the CIA secretly fomented a violent coup in Iran, which succeeded in ousting Mossadegh from power and making the Shah of Iran the supreme unelected dictator of the country.To fortify the Shah\\u2019s dictatorial hold on power, the CIA helped organize and train the his domestic police force, the Savak, which was essentially a combination of the CIA, the NSA, and the military. Part of the CIA\\u2019s training involved teaching Savak agents the art of torture.For the next 26 years, the Iranian people suffered under one of the most brutal and tyrannical dictatorships in the world, one that US officials fully supported and called an ally and friend of the United States.In 1979, Iranians successfully revolted against the Shah\\u2019s regime and ousted him from power. One result was not a restoration of the democratic system that had elected Mossadegh but rather another brutal dictatorship, this time a religious one. Another result is the bad relations between the Iran and US governments that continues to exist today.2. In 1951, the Guatemalan people democratically elected a man named Jacobo Arbenz to be their president. Arbenz, however, was not satisfactory to US officials, especially the national-security branch of the government, specifically the Pentagon and the CIA. The reason that US officials opposed Arbenz was that he was a socialist, and US officials considered a socialist president of Guatemala to be a threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States.In 1954 \\u2014 one year after the coup in Iran, the CIA fomented a violent military coup that succeeded in removing Arbenz from power and replacing him with one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in Latin American history, a man named Carlos Castillo Armas. The CIA had a kill list prepared for the coup, which Arbenz was able to escape by fleeing the country before Castillo was able to get him. The CIA\\u2019s destruction of Guatemala\\u2019s democratic system threw the nation into a 30-year civil war that ended up killing millions of Guatemalan people, especially many of the poor.3. In 1960 a man named Patrice Lamumba was elected Congo\\u2019s first prime minister after independence from Belgium. Lamumba spoke out against Western imperialism and refused to take sides in the Cold War, which caused the CIA to conclude that he was a threat to \\u201cnational security.\\u201d The CIA orchestrated the assassination of Lamumba, which ended up taking place on January 17, 1961, just three days before President Kennedy, who liked Lamumba and who would have ordered the CIA to stand down, was to be sworn into office.4. In 1970 a man named Salvador Allende received a plurality of votes in the presidential election in Chile. Pursuant to the Chilean constitution, the election was thrown into the national congress. President Richard Nixon, his national-security team, the Pentagon, and the CIA concluded that because Allende believed in communism and socialism, he posed a grave threat to \\u201cnational security\\u201d here in the United States. The CIA attempted to bribe members of the congress to vote against Allende. It also orchestrated the kidnapping of the head of Chile\\u2019s armed forces, Gen Rene Schneider, who opposed a US military coup in his country, especially since a coup would violate the country\\u2019s constitution. The kidnapping attempt on Schneider left him dead.The CIA then fomented a coup that took place on 9/11 1973 that violently ousted Allende from power and left him dead. Replacing him was army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, one of the most brutal unelected military dictators in history. By the time Pinochet\\u2019s 17-year reign of military terror came to an end in 1990, he and his CIA-supported goons had incarcerated, raped, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of innocent people \\u2014 that is, people whose only \\u201ccrime\\u201d was believing in socialism \\u2014 with the full support of the CIA, Pentagon, Nixon, and his \\u201cnational security\\u201d team.Of course, there are also the more recent support of regime-change operations that ousted democratically elected presidents that the US government disapproved of, such as in Ukraine and Egypt.And then there is the long list of countries where unelected dictators were targeted for regime change by the US national security state and, where successful, replaced with a brutal unelected pro-US dictator. Cuba, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria all come to mind.US officials need to keep in mind that when they point their accusatory index finger at Russia for supposedly meddling in the US presidential election, US officials have, at the same time, three fingers pointing back at themselves.

Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: \\u201cLike an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, \\u2018I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s.\\u2019 \\u201cI took a few steps towards them and said, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall.\\u2019 So they started attacking me. \\u201cI stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, that\\u2019s why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. \\u201cI got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. \\u201cThey were saying, \\u2018Islam, Islam!\\u2019 I said again, \\u2018F*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u2019 \\u201cIt was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. \\u201cLuckily, none of the blows were straight at me or I\\u2019d be dead. \\u201d A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, it\\u2019s really hard to imagine that he won\\u2019t get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. \\u201cF*** you, I\\u2019m Millwall!\\u201d has a nice ring to it.

He was caught using private email for work purposes while he was trying to take down Hillary Clinton for doing the same. And last week he flat out lied about an FBI letter in clear violation of federal law under the Hatch Act. But just when you think Chaffetz can\\u2019t be dirtier, it turns out his campaign is literally being funded by a criminal enterprise controlled by overseas investors. \\nThe single biggest campaign donor Jason Chaffetz is a company called Nu Skin Enterprises. Research done by Reverb Press has revealed that it adds up to nearly six figures in total, a surreal dollar amount for a fairly obscure company to give to a single Congressmen. But despite the lack of name recognition, Nu Skin is a billion dollar pyramid scheme which pushes questionable anti-aging miracle cures. And it\\u2019s been busted by the Feds for criminal behavior resulting in tens of millions of dollars in penalties. \\nBizarrely, Nu Skin Enterprises is now being bought up by overseas Chinese investors to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, placing the company largely under overseas control even as it\\u2019s begun its illegal business practices into China. Included in the investors list: family members of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. So what does this all have to do with Congressman Jason Chaffetz? In short, a busted criminal pyramid scheme now controlled by Chinese political figures has been funding its very own member of Congress from the very start of his political career. In fact, before entering politics, Chaffetz used to be an employee of the company. With each new turn, the story grows stranger.

[The Justice and Development Party (AKP) leader levelled the accusation at Chancellor Angela Merkel personally, according to EU Observer, while addressing a rally in Istanbul.  \\u201cYou are right now employing Nazi measures,\\u201d he declared. \\u201cAgainst who? My Turkish brother citizens in Germany and brother ministers. \\u201d The   \\u201cModerate Islamist\\u201d was referring to the Merkel administration refusing to allow the AKP to organise political rallies in Germany ahead of a Turkish referendum on 16 April. Germany is home to around three million Turks, and Erdo\\u011fan has been keen to court them, as well as other European diaspora communities, in support of his bid to increase executive powers.
